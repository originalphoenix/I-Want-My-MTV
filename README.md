Money for Nothing, Chicks for Free Youtube Jukebox

Jukebox spun off of juketube with a better layout and actually works.

Design Inspiration: https://www.behance.net/gallery/19435591/Songoroo

Jukebox UI/UX
- Clean up CSS
- Add CSS Animations to everything
- Show Icon where play button should be while youtube video is loading
- When youtube status is ended, show a gradient background instead of the youtube screen
- Fix the Modal for "playlist has ended" / Style it also

App UI/UX

- Change Colors
- Switch to Material Design Cards for everything
- Shove angular into everything once endpoints are set up
- Add "Create Playlist" Page

API 
- Users that create playlists also delete them
- Users that create playlists can only edit them
- Lock down GET so that only the app can make requests to it
- Need some way of relating "favorites" to a user account, not sure how yet :/ 

FUNCTIONALITY
- API endpoints instead of JSON files
- User Accounts
- Ability to load playlists from API
- Ability to save playlists with album art and tags
- Ability to loop playlists from the start
- Load next playlist via tags
- Add Favorites
- Live Search from youtube
- Give weight to "official" and "MV" 
- Drag and Drop Reordering
- User Accounts that save playlis
